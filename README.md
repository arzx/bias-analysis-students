# AI in Education Hackathon 2024
This project aims to analyze the fairness in student performance dataset [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics?resource=download). With our project we will display a exploratory data analysis and build a machine learning model, which is able to predict scores on test data. By that we can verify, if the model learns a bias and then favors/disfavors certain student groups.

## Results
![Project idea:]()

## Installation
### (Recommended) Setup new clean environment
Use a conda package manager.

#### Conda
Subsequently run these commands, following the prompted runtime instructions:
```bash
conda create -n bias-analysis python=3.12.15
conda activate bias-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Further Work
To further improve this project, the analysis can expand on other given classes and inspect their correlation. In order to process this visually, a dashboard would be effective.
